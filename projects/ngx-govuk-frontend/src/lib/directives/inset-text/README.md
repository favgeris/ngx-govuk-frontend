Inset text directive can be used on native `<div>` elements to enhance them with
[GDS Inset text](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/inset-text/)
styling.

Inset text can be used to differentiate a block of text from the content
that surrounds it, for example:

- quotes
- examples
- additional information about the page

Below you can find an example on how to use this directive:

```angular2html
<div govukInsetText>Inset text</div>
```
