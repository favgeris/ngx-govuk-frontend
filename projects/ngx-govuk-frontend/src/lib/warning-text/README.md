## Warning text

The phase banner component can be used when you need to warn users about something important, such as legal
consequences of an action, or lack of action, that they might take.
Design details can be found at [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/tag/).

Any content can be projected within the component, and will be displayed as the warning text.

### Inputs

- `assistiveText` - The hidden text('Warning' in the example).

### Example

```
