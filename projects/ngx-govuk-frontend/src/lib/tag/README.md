## Tag

The panel component can be used when it’s possible for something to have more than one status
and it’s useful for the user to know about that status.
Design details can be found at [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/tag/).

Any content can be projected within the component, and will be displayed as the tag body.
